# Francesco Grussu
This is my personal web page. If you prefer, you can also read it in [Sardinian](https://github.com/fragrussu/fragrussu.github.io/blob/master/README.srd.md).

## Who am I?
I am a Biomedical engineer born and raised in Sardinia who works in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. I graduated at the University of Cagliari (BEng in Biomedical engineering, 2009) and University of Genoa (MEng in Neuroengineering, 2012) and then obtained a PhD in Magnetic Resonance Physics (2016) at University College London (UCL; you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1477007/7/FGrussu_PhD_final_20160320.pdf)). 

Currently I work as a post-doc at UCL, where I am a member of the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and of the UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing. I have been Trainee representative of the White Matter Study Group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, of which I am member since 2013.

## My work
My research focus is in quantitative MRI (qMRI) acquisition and computational modelling. I have an interest in qMRI of brain and especially [spinal cord](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116884) for applications in neurodegnerative disorders (e.g. [multiple sclerosis](https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.445)). More recently, I have started working in [prostate MRI]((https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.116491)), using [artificial intelligence](https://github.com/fragrussu/sardunet) to tackle problems in protocol design and parameter estimation. 

My mission is to make MRI better using computational tools, enabling the detection of pathology much earlier than what we can do today, for the benefit of patients. You can find my works in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Zj5Vt3YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0945-3909/print).

## My code
I strongly believe in the importance of open science and I share my code and data whenever I can. Below you can find a list of code repositories that I have made openly available.
