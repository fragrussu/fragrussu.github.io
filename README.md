# Francesco Grussu
This is my personal web page. If you prefer, you can also read it in [Sardinian](https://github.com/fragrussu/fragrussu.github.io/blob/master/README.srd.md) and [Italian](https://github.com/fragrussu/fragrussu.github.io/blob/master/README.it.md).

## My profile
I am a Biomedical engineer born and raised in Sardinia who works in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. I graduated at the University of Cagliari (BEng in Biomedical engineering, 2009) and University of Genoa (MEng in Neuroengineering, 2012) and then obtained a PhD in Magnetic Resonance Physics (2016) at University College London (UCL) (you can find my **PhD thesis [here](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1477007/7/FGrussu_PhD_final_20160320.pdf)**). 

I have worked as a post-doc at UCL from 2016 to 2020, where I was a member of the Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Centre for Medical Image Computing. I keep collaborating closely with UCL, at which I hold a Honorary Senior Research Associate post. 

I have been Trainee representative of the White Matter Study Group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), of which I am a member since 2013. 

Since October 2020 I have joined the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (Barcelona, Spain) as post-doctoral researcher to work on radiomics and quantitative MRI (qMRI) in different types of body cancer.

## My work
My research focus is in qMRI acquisition and computational modelling. I have an interest in qMRI of brain and especially [spinal cord](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116884) for applications in neurodegnerative disorders (e.g. [multiple sclerosis](https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.445)). More recently, I have started working in [prostate MRI](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.116491), using [artificial intelligence](https://github.com/fragrussu/sardunet) to tackle problems in protocol design and parameter estimation, and in various types of body cancer which I investigate with state-of-the-art qMRI. 

My mission is to make MRI better using computational tools, enabling the detection of pathology much earlier than what we can do today, for the benefit of patients.

## My code
I strongly believe in the importance of open science and I share my code and data whenever I can. Below you can find a list of code repositories that I have made openly available.

* [StructureTensorToolbox](https://github.com/fragrussu/StructureTensorToolbox): a structure tensor analysis toolbox for MATLAB, useful to analyse 2D histological images.

* [MyRelax](https://github.com/fragrussu/MyRelax): a collection of Python tools to perform myelin and relaxation analyses in MRI.

* [MRItools](https://github.com/fragrussu/MRItools): a collection of Python and MATLAB tools that can help when handling MRI data.

* [SARDU-Net](https://github.com/fragrussu/sardunet): a command-line Python implementation of the _Select And Retrieve via Direct Upsampling_ network (SARDU-Net) algorithm, for data-driven, model-free qMRI protocol design.

* [qMRI-Net](https://github.com/fragrussu/qMRINet): a command-line Python toolbox for model fitting and qMRI resampling based on deep learning.

* [PaperScripts](https://github.com/fragrussu/PaperScripts): data and code used to write a number of papers.
